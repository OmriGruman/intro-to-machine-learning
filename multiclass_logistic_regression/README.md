# Multiclass Logistic Regression

In this assignment [Shiraz](https://github.com/shirazs-git) and I implemented the [Logistic Regression algorithm](logistic_regression.ipynb), using gradient descent to find the optimal solution.\

First, we define our hypothesis space, and developed the loss function and its derivative.\
Then, we implemented the algorithm, and applied it on the famous Iris Dataset.
